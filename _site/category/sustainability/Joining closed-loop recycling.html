              Joining closed-loop recycling
            </h2>

            <p>
              Joining closed-loop recycling in the fashion domain refers to the
              practice of participating in a recycling system where materials
              from discarded or worn-out garments are collected, processed, and
              reintroduced into the production of new clothing items. It
              involves creating a closed-loop system where the materials used in
              the fashion industry are continuously recycled and reused,
              reducing the need for virgin resources and minimizing waste. In
              more detail, joining closed-loop recycling involves several steps
              and stakeholders:
            </p>

            <h4 id="collection">Collection</h4>

            <p>
              Garment brands or retailers collect used clothing items from
              consumers through various channels, such as in-store collection
              bins, take-back programs, or mail-in options. These items may
              include damaged garments, unsold inventory, or customer returns.
              Sorting and Processing: The collected garments are sorted based on
              their material composition, condition, and potential for
              recycling. This step ensures that different materials can be
              appropriately processed and transformed into new products. Any
              non-recyclable components, such as zippers or buttons, are
              separated for proper disposal.
            </p>

            <h4 id="recycling-and-regeneration">Recycling and Regeneration</h4>

            <p>
              The sorted garments are then processed through various recycling
              methods, such as mechanical recycling or chemical processes.
              Mechanical recycling involves shredding the textiles into fibers,
              which can be spun into new yarns and fabrics. Chemical processes,
              such as depolymerization or dissolution, break down the textile
              fibers into their base components for the production of new
              materials.
            </p>

            <h4 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h4>

            <p>
              The recycled materials are transformed into new fashion products,
              including clothing, accessories, or even footwear. These products
              may incorporate a blend of recycled materials with virgin
              materials, depending on the desired quality and performance.
            </p>

            <h4 id="consumer-awareness-and-education">
              Consumer Awareness and Education
            </h4>

            <p>
              Communicating the importance and benefits of closed-loop recycling
              to consumers is crucial. Brands and retailers play a vital role in
              raising awareness about the recycling programs they offer,
              educating customers about the significance of recycling, and
              encouraging them to participate in the closed-loop system.
            </p>

            <p>
              By joining closed-loop recycling, fashion brands and retailers
              contribute to the circular economy by extending the lifespan of
              materials, reducing waste, and minimizing the environmental impact
              of the fashion industry. This approach promotes resource
              efficiency, reduces the demand for new raw materials, and helps
              address the issue of textile waste.

            <h4 id="levis-wasteless">Levi’s Waste&lt;Less™</h4>

            <p>
              Levi’s introduced the Waste&lt;Less™ collection, which
              incorporates recycled post-consumer waste, including plastic
              bottles, into their denim products. They have partnered with
              recycling facilities to convert plastic bottles into polyester
              fibers used in their jeans.
            </p>

            <h4 id="hm-conscious-collection">H&amp;M Conscious Collection</h4>

            <p>
              H&amp;M, a fast-fashion retailer, launched its Conscious
              Collection, which focuses on using sustainable materials and
              implementing closed-loop practices. They have introduced garment
              collection initiatives where customers can return their used
              clothing to H&amp;M stores for recycling and receive a discount on
              their next purchase.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reformation">Reformation</h4>

            <p>
              Reformation is a sustainable fashion brand that promotes
              closed-loop recycling through their “RefRecycling” program. They
              accept used garments from customers and recycle them into new
              fabrics or donate them to charity. Reformation aims to reduce
              waste and minimize the environmental footprint of their clothing
              production.

            <p>
              Adidas partnered with Parley for the Oceans to create a collection
              of sportswear using recycled ocean plastic. The plastic waste
              collected from coastal areas and beaches is transformed into yarns
              and materials used in the production of shoes, apparel, and
              accessories.
