    <h2 id="from-sustainable-to-circular-materials">From sustainable to circular materials</h2>

<p>Sustainable to circular materials refers to the shift in the fashion industry towards using materials that not only have a low environmental impact but also contribute to a circular economy. Sustainable materials are those that are responsibly sourced, produced with minimal harm to the environment, and have a reduced carbon footprint. These materials may include organic cotton, hemp, recycled polyester, and other eco-friendly alternatives.  However, the concept of circular materials goes beyond sustainability by emphasizing the need for materials that can be recycled, reused, or biodegraded at the end of their life cycle.</p>

<p>Circular materials aim to close the loop by ensuring that resources are continuously used and waste is minimized. This involves designing products with materials that can be easily disassembled, separated, and transformed into new materials or products through recycling or upcycling processes.  To achieve the transition from sustainable to circular materials, various strategies are employed in the fashion industry. This includes the use of innovative technologies and processes to create materials that are both sustainable and recyclable. For example, companies may develop fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles, discarded textiles, or agricultural waste.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the implementation of extended producer responsibility (EPR) programs can encourage brands to take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products, including the materials used. EPR programs promote the collection, recycling, and responsible disposal of products at the end of their use.  In addition, collaborations and partnerships between fashion brands, textile manufacturers, and recycling facilities play a crucial role in driving the adoption of circular materials. By working together, they can develop scalable solutions and innovative techniques to transform waste materials into new fibers, fabrics, or components for the fashion industry.</p>

<p>Overall, the shift from sustainable to circular materials in the fashion domain represents a more holistic approach to environmental sustainability. It aims to reduce the industry’s reliance on finite resources, minimize waste generation, and promote a circular economy where materials are continuously cycled and reused, contributing to a more sustainable and regenerative fashion industry.</p>
