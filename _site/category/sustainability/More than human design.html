    <h2 id="more-than-human-design">More than human design</h2>

<p>More than human design, refers to a design approach that considers not only the needs and preferences of human users but also the broader ecological and social impact of fashion products. It takes into account the well-being of all stakeholders involved, including animals, ecosystems, and the environment.</p>

<p>This design approach acknowledges the interconnectedness of all living beings and aims to create fashion products and systems that are sustainable, ethical,inclusive, and respectful of all living beings, promoting a harmonious relationship between fashion and nature.</p>

<p>More than human design recognizes that fashion does not exist in isolation from the natural world and other species. It acknowledges the detrimental effects of traditional fashion practices on the environment, such as pollution, waste generation, and the exploitation of resources. More than human design seeks to mitigate these negative impacts by integrating sustainable practices throughout the entire fashion value chain.</p>

<p>More than human design involves adopting alternative materials and production methods that minimize harm to animals and the environment. This includes using plant-based and recycled materials, adopting organic farming practices, and reducing the use of harmful chemicals in textile production. It also entails considering the welfare of animals and ensuring that fashion products do not involve the use of fur, exotic skins, or other materials obtained through cruel practices.</p>

<p>Furthermore, more than human design extends beyond product design and encompasses the entire lifecycle of fashion, from sourcing to manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal. It involves embracing circular economy principles, such as designing for durability, reparability, and recyclability. It also emphasizes the importance of responsible and transparent supply chains, fair labor practices, and social responsibility.</p>

<p>Note: “More than human design” is a relatively new concept within the fashion industry, and not many companies explicitly use this term. However, various fashion brands and initiatives are incorporating sustainable and ethical practices that align with the principles of more than human design.</p>
