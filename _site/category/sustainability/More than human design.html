          <div class="post-content">
            <h2 id="more-than-human-design">More than human design</h2>

            <p>
              More than human design, refers to a design approach that considers
              not only the needs and preferences of human users but also the
              broader ecological and social impact of fashion products. It takes
              into account the well-being of all stakeholders involved,
              including animals, ecosystems, and the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              This design approach acknowledges the interconnectedness of all
              living beings and aims to create fashion products and systems that
              are sustainable, ethical,inclusive, and respectful of all living
              beings, promoting a harmonious relationship between fashion and
              nature.
            </p>

            <p>
              More than human design recognizes that fashion does not exist in
              isolation from the natural world and other species. It
              acknowledges the detrimental effects of traditional fashion
              practices on the environment, such as pollution, waste generation,
              and the exploitation of resources. More than human design seeks to
              mitigate these negative impacts by integrating sustainable
              practices throughout the entire fashion value chain.
            </p>

            <p>
              More than human design involves adopting alternative materials and
              production methods that minimize harm to animals and the
              environment. This includes using plant-based and recycled
              materials, adopting organic farming practices, and reducing the
              use of harmful chemicals in textile production. It also entails
              considering the welfare of animals and ensuring that fashion
              products do not involve the use of fur, exotic skins, or other
              materials obtained through cruel practices.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, more than human design extends beyond product design
              and encompasses the entire lifecycle of fashion, from sourcing to
              manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal. It involves
              embracing circular economy principles, such as designing for
              durability, reparability, and recyclability. It also emphasizes
              the importance of responsible and transparent supply chains, fair
              labor practices, and social responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: “More than human design” is a relatively new concept within
              the fashion industry, and not many companies explicitly use this
              term. However, various fashion brands and initiatives are
              incorporating sustainable and ethical practices that align with
              the principles of more than human design.
