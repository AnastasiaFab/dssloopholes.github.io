            <h2 id="design-for-disassembly">Design for disassembly</h2>

            <p>
              Design for disassembly is an approach that involves intentionally
              designing products in a way that allows for easy and efficient
              disassembly at the end of their life cycle. It focuses on creating
              products that can be easily taken apart, separating different
              components and materials for reuse, recycling, or other forms of
              responsible disposal.
            </p>

            <p>
              This design principle aligns with the 6Rs of sustainability,
              particularly the concepts of reuse, repair, and recycle. Design
              for disassembly means creating garments and accessories with
              components that can be easily separated and disassembled. This
              includes using fasteners, connectors, or other mechanisms that
              enable the straightforward removal of individual parts, such as
              buttons, zippers, linings, and trims. By considering the
              disassembly process during the design phase, fashion products can
              be more easily repaired, altered, or repurposed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The aim of design for disassembly is to extend the lifespan of
              fashion items and reduce waste. By enabling disassembly, it
              becomes easier to repair damaged parts, replace worn-out
              components, or transform the garment into a new style. This
              approach promotes circularity by facilitating the reuse of
              materials and reducing the need for new resource extraction.
            </p>

            <p>
              Designing for disassembly also supports the recycling process. By
              separating different materials, such as fabrics, buttons, and
              zippers, at the end of a garment’s life, these components can be
              recycled more effectively. Designers can consider using recyclable
              materials and avoiding complex material blends that are
              challenging to separate. This enables the recycling of fashion
              products into new textiles or other usable materials, contributing
              to a more sustainable and closed-loop system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, incorporating design for disassembly in fashion can
              encourage a shift towards a more sustainable and responsible
              consumption mindset. When consumers are aware that their garments
              are designed for disassembly, they are more likely to engage in
              repair, alteration, or recycling initiatives. This promotes a
              culture of conscious consumption and encourages individuals to
              participate actively in the circular economy.
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, design for disassembly in the fashion domain involves
              intentionally designing products with the ability to be easily
              disassembled at the end of their life cycle. It promotes the
              principles of reuse, repair, and recycle, as part of the 6Rs of
              sustainability. By considering disassembly in the design process,
              fashion products can be more easily repaired, components can be
              reused or recycled, and the overall environmental impact of the
              fashion industry can be minimized.
