            <h2 id="post-use-materials">Post-use materials</h2>

            <p>
              Post-use materials refers to materials that have been previously
              used by consumers and are no longer needed in their original form.
              In the fashion domain, post-use materials typically refer to
              textiles and clothing items that have reached the end of their
              life cycle and are ready for disposal or recycling.
            </p>

            <p>
              Post-use materials encompass various types of textiles and
              garments that have served their primary purpose and are no longer
              suitable for continued use. These materials can include worn-out
              or damaged clothing, discarded textile scraps, surplus inventory,
              or even products returned by customers. Instead of being discarded
              as waste, these materials can be redirected into recycling or
              upcycling processes to create new products or extend their
              lifespan.
            </p>

            <p>
              The concept of post-use materials aligns with the principles of
              circular economy and sustainable fashion. Rather than perpetuating
              a linear “take-make-dispose” model, post-use materials present an
              opportunity to recover and reintegrate valuable resources back
              into the fashion supply chain. By collecting, sorting, and
              processing these materials, fashion brands and manufacturers can
              reduce the environmental impact associated with production and
              minimize waste generation.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to recycling, post-use materials can also be
              repurposed or upcycled. Repurposing involves transforming the
              materials into new products or applications, while upcycling
              entails creating higher-value products from the existing
              materials. These approaches contribute to the reduction of
              resource consumption and promote a more sustainable and circular
              fashion industry.
