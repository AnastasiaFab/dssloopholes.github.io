<h2 id="collaborative-consumption">Collaborative consumption</h2>

<p>Collaborative consumption, also known as the sharing economy or peer-to-peer sharing, refers to a consumption model in which individuals or communities share resources, products, or services among themselves rather than owning them individually.</p>

<p>It is a shift away from traditional ownership-based consumption towards a more collaborative and access-based approach. In the fashion domain, collaborative consumption involves sharing and exchanging clothing and accessories, allowing individuals to access a wide range of fashion items without the need for full ownership.</p>

<p>Collaborative consumption can take various forms. One prominent example is clothing rental platforms, where individuals can rent garments for a specific period rather than purchasing them outright. These platforms provide access to a diverse selection of clothing styles and brands, allowing users to experiment with different looks and wear designer pieces at a fraction of the cost. It promotes a more sustainable approach to fashion by reducing the need for single-use garments and encouraging the reuse of clothing items.</p>

<p>Another aspect of collaborative consumption in fashion is peer-to-peer sharing platforms, where individuals can lend or borrow clothing from one another. These platforms facilitate direct interactions between users, creating a community-driven sharing network.</p>

<p>Users can list their own clothing items that they are willing to lend, and others can borrow those items for a specific duration. This fosters a sense of community and promotes the idea of shared ownership, enabling individuals to maximize the usage of their wardrobe and reduce the overall demand for new clothing.</p>

<p>Collaborative consumption in the fashion domain can also extend to clothing swaps or exchanges. These events or online platforms enable individuals to exchange their pre-owned clothing items with others. Participants bring in garments they no longer wear or need and can swap them for items of similar value. Clothing swaps promote sustainability by giving garments a new lease on life and reducing the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills.</p>

<p>Furthermore, collaborative consumption can involve co-creation platforms where users can participate in the design process of fashion items. This allows individuals to contribute their ideas, preferences, and skills, resulting in personalized and unique clothing pieces. Through these platforms, users can collaborate with designers or brands to create custom-made garments or accessories, fostering a sense of involvement and creativity in the fashion experience.</p>
