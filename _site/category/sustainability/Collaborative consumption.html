            <h2 id="collaborative-consumption">Collaborative consumption</h2>

            <p>
              Collaborative consumption, also known as the sharing economy or
              peer-to-peer sharing, refers to a consumption model in which
              individuals or communities share resources, products, or services
              among themselves rather than owning them individually.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is a shift away from traditional ownership-based consumption
              towards a more collaborative and access-based approach. In the
              fashion domain, collaborative consumption involves sharing and
              exchanging clothing and accessories, allowing individuals to
              access a wide range of fashion items without the need for full
              ownership.
            </p>

            <p>
              Collaborative consumption can take various forms. One prominent
              example is clothing rental platforms, where individuals can rent
              garments for a specific period rather than purchasing them
              outright. These platforms provide access to a diverse selection of
              clothing styles and brands, allowing users to experiment with
              different looks and wear designer pieces at a fraction of the
              cost. It promotes a more sustainable approach to fashion by
              reducing the need for single-use garments and encouraging the
              reuse of clothing items.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another aspect of collaborative consumption in fashion is
              peer-to-peer sharing platforms, where individuals can lend or
              borrow clothing from one another. These platforms facilitate
              direct interactions between users, creating a community-driven
              sharing network.
            </p>

            <p>
              Users can list their own clothing items that they are willing to
              lend, and others can borrow those items for a specific duration.
              This fosters a sense of community and promotes the idea of shared
              ownership, enabling individuals to maximize the usage of their
              wardrobe and reduce the overall demand for new clothing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Collaborative consumption in the fashion domain can also extend to
              clothing swaps or exchanges. These events or online platforms
              enable individuals to exchange their pre-owned clothing items with
              others. Participants bring in garments they no longer wear or need
              and can swap them for items of similar value. Clothing swaps
              promote sustainability by giving garments a new lease on life and
              reducing the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, collaborative consumption can involve co-creation
              platforms where users can participate in the design process of
              fashion items. This allows individuals to contribute their ideas,
              preferences, and skills, resulting in personalized and unique
              clothing pieces. Through these platforms, users can collaborate
              with designers or brands to create custom-made garments or
              accessories, fostering a sense of involvement and creativity in
              the fashion experience.
