# About Loopholes Games

Welcome to Loopholes Games, where strategy meets serious game design!


The Loopholes toolkit is centered on a design game that supports participants to create complete user journeys and data flows that open the gateway to future production systems, taking sustainability and the impact of different technologies into account. The game was designed to enable participants to reflect on the (current) processes of their companies and scale them into product-service Ecosystems and Ecologies. In showing that current challenges can be solved through different strategies, each game can create a different localized solution for how their companies can transition towards circularity through digitalisation.

The Loopholes design game is composed by a game board, a deck of strategy cards, and this extended content website. In this page you can find further details about each of the strategies in the Loopholes card deck to gain insights on how they might be applied through relevant case studies.

# The Loopholes Game Experience

Loopholes Games introduces a unique and immersive experience through our physical board game designed specifically for companies. This game allows players to explore and navigate the complexities of adopting new technologies within the context of circular business models.

# How It Works

In the game, players start by selecting a specific product or service they plan to produce and envision a timeframe for its development. The game board, modeled after the UPPSSG framework, guides players through various stages and challenges of their circular business journey.

Throughout the game, trigger cards prompt players with educational insights and challenges related to each quadrant on the board. These prompts encourage critical thinking and strategic decision-making, allowing players to gain a deeper understanding of the impact that data and technology can have on their product or service propositions.
