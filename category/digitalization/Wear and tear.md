## Wear and tear

Wear and tear in the context of product usage refers to the gradual deterioration and damage that occurs to an item over time as a result of its use, consumption, and the habits of its wearer. It is an inevitable consequence of regular use and reflects the impact of factors such as friction, stress, washing, and environmental conditions on the product's condition. The knowledge and data gathered from studying wear and tear can provide valuable insights into various aspects of the fashion industry.

Wear and tear data provides valuable insights into product durability, user behavior, and sustainability within the fashion industry. By utilizing this data, companies can enhance product design, inform manufacturing processes, promote responsible consumption, and contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and circular fashion ecosystem.

#### Product Durability and Quality

Wear and tear data serves as an indicator of a product's durability and quality. By examining the extent and nature of wear and tear, manufacturers and designers can gain valuable insights into how well a product withstands everyday use. This information can guide them in selecting higher-quality materials, enhancing construction techniques, and improving product design to ensure longevity and customer satisfaction.

#### User Behavior and Habits

Wear and tear data can shed light on the habits and behaviors of the product's wearer. By analyzing patterns of wear and tear, companies can understand how customers engage with their products. This knowledge helps in tailoring future designs and product features to better align with user preferences, ensuring that fashion items are better suited to withstand the demands of specific lifestyles or usage scenarios.

#### Sustainability and Circular Economy

Wear and tear data plays a crucial role in advancing sustainability and circularity within the fashion industry. By assessing the areas of a product most prone to wear and tear, companies can focus on implementing strategies to increase product longevity and reduce waste. This includes using more durable materials, reinforcing high-stress areas, and designing for ease of repair, allowing for extended product use and minimizing the environmental impact associated with premature disposal.

#### Maintenance and Aftercare

Wear and tear data informs recommendations for maintenance and aftercare of fashion items. By understanding the specific areas that are subject to the most wear, companies can provide users with guidance on how to care for and maintain their garments effectively. This may involve instructions for proper washing, storage, and repair techniques, enabling users to proactively address wear-related issues and extend the life of their products.

#### Digitalization and IoT Integration

Wear and tear data can be collected and analyzed through sensors, smart tags, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices embedded in garments. These digitalization efforts enable real-time monitoring of product usage and condition. The data collected can be used to optimize production, track product lifecycles, offer personalized services, and support sustainable practices such as repair, resale, or recycling.

By harnessing knowledge and data about wear and tear, the fashion industry can make more informed decisions, enhance product durability, optimize production processes, promote responsible product use, and facilitate the transition towards circularity, sustainability, and digitization. This holistic approach benefits both the environment and the users by reducing waste, extending product lifespans, and fostering more conscious consumption habits.

### Case studies

#### Patagonia's Worn Wear Program

Patagonia collects data on the wear and tear of their products through their Worn Wear program. users can bring back their worn-out garments to Patagonia stores, where the items are assessed for repairability. The data gathered from this program helps Patagonia understand the durability of their products, identify common areas of wear and tear, and inform their design and production processes.

#### Mud Jeans' Lease a Jeans Model

Mud Jeans, a Dutch denim brand, offers a lease model where users can lease a pair of jeans instead of buying them outright. The company collects data on the wear and tear of leased jeans, which helps them analyze usage patterns and optimize their product design and manufacturing processes. The insights gained from wear and tear data contribute to producing more durable and longer-lasting denim products.

#### Levi's Care Tag for Our Planet

Levi's launched their Care Tag for Our Planet initiative, which provides users with information on sustainable care practices for their garments. By understanding the wear and tear patterns of their products, Levi's provides care instructions that enable customers to prolong the lifespan of their clothing, reducing unnecessary waste and promoting responsible consumption.

#### EON Group's CircularID™ Protocol

EON Group developed the CircularID™ protocol, which uses digital identifiers to track and monitor the lifecycle of fashion products. By incorporating wear and tear data into the digital identity of each product, brands and consumers can make informed decisions about repairs, maintenance, and end-of-life options. This data-driven approach promotes circularity by enabling more efficient product management and reducing waste.
