Data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) increasingly play crucial roles in the fashion industry, revolutionizing various aspects of the business, from design and production to marketing and customer experience. Traditionally, every sound business utilizes historical sales data, market trends, and other relevant information to predict future demand and optimize inventory levels. Nowadays, Machine Learning algorithms allow for more accurate demand forecasting, further potentially reducing overstock and stockouts. Blockchain technologies also help by enhancing transparency and traceability in the supply chain, allowing for richer information, and using data analytics helps optimize production schedules, logistics, and supply chain efficiency. These technologies will largely aid the post-use sorting process. That information is also used in marketing, using data to understand customer preferences and behavior, enabling targeted marketing campaigns. Still, from a demand perspective, implementing AI-driven recommendation engines can help suggest personalized products based on individual customer preferences and browsing history. Natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis connect that data to public opinion and trends on social media platforms, making these methods even more effective. Once a product of choice is determined, implementing AR and computer vision technologies for virtual try-on experiences allows customers to visualize how garments will look on them before making a purchase. Employing AI algorithms also aids in generating design ideas, helping designers explore a broader range of possibilities. By integrating computer vision to analyze trends and provide insights during the creative process, original designs can be made that have a higher chance to appeal to a larger public.
