### Case Studies

**Adidas**  
Adidas has integrated biobased materials into its footwear packaging, using plant-based plastics and paper derived from agricultural waste. These materials are designed to be biodegradable, allowing them to decompose naturally and return to the earth without leaving harmful residues. This initiative is part of Adidas' broader "End Plastic Waste" campaign, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to a circular economy. Through these sustainable practices, Adidas demonstrates how the fashion and footwear industries can reduce their environmental impact.

**Lush Cosmetics**  
Lush Cosmetics is known for its commitment to sustainable packaging. The brand uses recycled materials for its packaging and offers a "naked" line of products that are sold without packaging. Lush’s approach minimizes waste and reduces the brand’s overall environmental footprint.

**Puma**  
PUMA introduced the Clever Little Bag as a multi-functional and reusable packaging solution, replacing traditional shoeboxes. The design features a minimal cardboard tray and a reusable fabric bag made from recycled materials. This innovative approach reduces cardboard use by 65% and encourages consumers to reuse the fabric bag, significantly lowering the environmental impact of packaging. PUMA's Clever Little Bag showcases how packaging can be both practical and sustainable, adding value while promoting environmental responsibility.
