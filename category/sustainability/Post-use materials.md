## Post-use materials

Post-Use Materials refers to materials that have been previously used by users and are no longer needed in their original form. In the fashion domain, post-use materials typically refer to textiles and clothing items that have reached the end of their life cycle and are ready for disposal or recycling.

Post-use materials encompass various types of textiles and garments that have served their primary purpose and are no longer suitable for continued use. These materials can include worn-out or damaged clothing, discarded textile scraps, surplus inventory, or even products returned by customers. Instead of being discarded as waste, these materials can be redirected into recycling or upcycling processes to create new products or extend their lifespan.

The concept of post-use materials aligns with the principles of circular economy and sustainable fashion. Rather than perpetuating a linear "take-make-dispose" model, post-use materials present an opportunity to recover and reintegrate valuable resources back into the fashion supply chain. By collecting, sorting, and processing these materials, fashion brands and manufacturers can reduce the environmental impact associated with production and minimize waste generation.

In addition to recycling, post-use materials can also be repurposed or upcycled. Repurposing involves transforming the materials into new products or applications, while upcycling entails creating higher-value products from the existing materials. These approaches contribute to the reduction of resource consumption and promote a more sustainable and circular fashion industry.
