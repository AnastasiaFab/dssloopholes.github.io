**Circular revenue models** focus on generating income while promoting sustainability by **recycling**, **upcycling**, and **reusing materials**. These models offer fashion companies the opportunity to create value not only through direct sales but also by adopting innovative approaches such as **subscription services**, **rental models**, and **digital platforms**. By aligning their revenue strategies with sustainable practices, companies can reduce waste and improve their **environmental footprint** while maintaining profitability. 

This unit explores the key components of circular revenue models and how they can be implemented in the fashion system to drive both **sustainability** and **profitability**.
