Circular Marketing is more than just convincing people to buy; it involves building a continuous relationship with consumers by supporting life-cycle activities such as repair, reuse, and information exchange. The concept of Circular Loyalty Loops aims to create long-term engagement by encouraging consumers to actively participate in the circular economy. Marketing efforts in this space focus on community building, where repair events, upcycling workshops, and information-sharing platforms create a shared experience for consumers, reinforcing both brand loyalty and sustainability. This unit explores how businesses can foster deeper consumer relationships by integrating circular marketing strategies that promote reuse, repair, and shared responsibility for fashion products.

This circular system not only builds customer loyalty but also minimizes waste, promoting sustainability through leasing and recycling loops.
