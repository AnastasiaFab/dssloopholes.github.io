    <h3> Textile Labelling Requirements (TLR) </h3>
New laws such as the Textile Labeling Requirements provide information that creates new opportunities for future repair and recycling along with the sharing understanding with all the people involved in the textile process (Stakeholders).    
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
How can you provide clear information for the person who will be repairing or recycling the garment seven years from now?
    <br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
How can you design a system that allows for future changes within the system (legislation, new materials, prodution processes) that do not exist yet (futureproof)?

Textile Labelling Requirements (TLR) aim to ensure transparency in the fashion industry by providing clear and accurate information on garment composition, sourcing, and production processes. TLR can play a pivotal role in fostering sustainable and ethical practices by making the garment’s journey visible, from raw material extraction to its finished state. This transparency builds trust between brands and consumers, promoting responsible choices while complying with global regulations related to sustainability. Labels may include data on eco-friendly materials, ethical sourcing, and fair labour practices, and can be applied through traditional methods or newer technologies like QR codes, RFID, or NTC tags. TLR is not only a means to comply with laws but also a tool to align brands with future changes in production processes, material innovations, and legislation.
