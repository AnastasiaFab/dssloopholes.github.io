    <h3> Life-Cycle Costing </h3>
Life-cycle costing (LCC) is an accounting method that considers the total cost of a product throughout its life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-lifes disposal. This helps businesses make informed decisions about production, pricing, and sustainability, promoting the use of durable and high-quality products.  
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
Why should we think about all the costs of making, using, and throwing away a product?
    <br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
How can life cycle costing support sustainability initiatives and improve decision-making in a fashion system?

**Life-Cycle Costing (LCC)** is an accounting method that assesses the total cost of a product throughout its entire life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to its end-of-life disposal. In the context of the fashion industry, LCC provides businesses with a comprehensive view of the financial and environmental impacts of a product over time. This enables better decision-making around **production, pricing, and sustainability**. By understanding the full cost implications of a product, businesses are able to create durable, high-quality garments that align with **sustainability goals** and meet the growing demand for **responsibly sourced** products. LCC promotes transparency, helping businesses to consider both economic and environmental factors, guiding them toward more sustainable practices.

### Case Studies
