    <h3> Re-Positioning </h3>
Price elasticity is what we call the extent to which people react to changes in price. Sometimes changing the prices could lead to a higher economic, but also societal impact (more people using the product/service). Pricing however is a crucial marketing variable that also informs potential users about the quality of the value proposition.

(Re)Positioning in the fashion domain refers to the strategic process of changing or adjusting the perception, image, or market positioning of a fashion brand, product, or service within the competitive landscape. It involves redefining the target audience, value proposition, brand identity, and marketing strategies to establish a unique and differentiated position in the market.

#### Assessing the competitive landscape

(Re)positioning begins with a thorough analysis of the competitive landscape in the fashion industry. Fashion brands need to understand their competitors, their target market segments, and the positioning strategies they have adopted. This analysis helps identify gaps, opportunities, and areas where the brand can differentiate itself to gain a competitive edge.

#### Identifying target audience

(Re)positioning involves identifying or redefining the target audience for the fashion brand. This could involve narrowing down the target market segment or expanding to new customer segments. Understanding the target audience's demographics, preferences, values, and behaviors is crucial for crafting a tailored value proposition and marketing messages that resonate with the intended users.

#### Defining value proposition

(Re)positioning requires defining a clear and compelling value proposition that sets the brand apart from its competitors. This involves identifying the unique selling points, competitive advantages, and key brand attributes that appeal to the target audience. The value proposition should communicate the brand's core values, quality, aesthetics, sustainability, innovation, or any other distinctive factors that differentiate it from competitors.

#### Brand identity and image

(Re)positioning often involves reshaping or refining the brand identity and image to align with the desired positioning. This includes elements such as brand name, logo, visual identity, tone of voice, and overall brand personality. The brand identity should reflect the brand's positioning strategy and resonate with the target audience, evoking the desired emotions and perceptions.

#### Marketing and communication strategies:

(Re)positioning necessitates developing new marketing and communication strategies to effectively convey the brand's message and reach the target audience. This may involve revamping advertising campaigns, social media presence, content marketing, influencer collaborations, or other promotional activities. The messaging and communication channels should be tailored to the target audience's preferences and behaviors, ensuring maximum impact and engagement.

#### Product and service offering

(Re)positioning might also involve adjusting or expanding the product or service offering to align with the new positioning strategy. This could involve introducing new product lines, collaborating with designers or influencers, or incorporating innovative features or sustainable practices. The product or service offering should deliver on the brand promise and meet the evolving needs and expectations of the target audience.

#### Market testing and evaluation

(Re)positioning requires monitoring and evaluating the impact of the changes implemented. Market testing and customer feedback play a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of the (re)positioning strategy. This feedback helps identify areas for further improvement and refinement to ensure the brand's positioning aligns with customer perceptions and preferences.
