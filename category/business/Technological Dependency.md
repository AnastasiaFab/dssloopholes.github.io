    <h3> Technological Dependency </h3>
A company uses many tools, materials, machines in order to create its products and services. Some of these are however more important than others. That means companies are particularly dependent on them. A problem can arise if one of these become unaccessible as the company becomes dependent.
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
On which technologies (Tools, Materials, Software, Machines) do you depend on?
    <br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
 What is the impact of the technologies needed for your product-service? Can you find alternatives that are more sustainable?

Technological dependency in the fashion industry refers to the reliance on specific tools, materials, machines, or software that are critical for the production and delivery of fashion products and services. Some technologies are more integral to the production process than others, and a company may face significant disruptions if these become inaccessible. This unit explores how fashion companies assess their technological dependencies and the potential risks associated with them. Participants will analyze the impact of these dependencies on the product-service lifecycle and explore sustainable alternatives to reduce reliance on technologies that may pose risks or be unsustainable in the long term.

### Case Studies

**Appalatch Clothing**
Appalatch, a small sustainable apparel company, faced significant challenges with their technological dependency on a specific knitting machine used to produce their wool garments. When the machine broke down, they had to rely on skilled labor to maintain production, which increased costs. The company realized that diversifying its machine suppliers and investing in maintenance training was essential to reduce its reliance on a single technology.

**Pinatex**
Pinatex is a material company that produces an alternative to leather using pineapple leaves. Their production process relies heavily on specific extraction machines designed to pull fibers from the leaves. Technological disruptions in the supply of these machines could slow down production or halt their sustainable material output. To mitigate this risk, Pinatex explores partnerships with machinery producers and is developing manual extraction techniques that could serve as a backup.

**ByBorre**
ByBorre, an Amsterdam-based textile innovation studio, relies heavily on 3D knitting technology to create their bespoke fabrics. This reliance makes them vulnerable to disruptions if the knitting machines or the software controlling them become unavailable. ByBorre mitigates this risk by collaborating with multiple machine providers and investing in open-source software alternatives, which enhances resilience and flexibility in their production processes.

**Ecovative**
Ecovative, a small biomaterials company, produces sustainable alternatives to plastic using mushroom mycelium. Their production process depends on highly specific bioreactors and environmental control systems. A failure or disruption in access to these systems could dramatically affect production. To mitigate dependency risks, Ecovative has worked on optimizing small-scale, modular bioreactor units that allow for easier maintenance and reduced reliance on external providers.
