    <h3> Technology Readiness Levels / Society Readiness Levels </h3>
Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) assess the maturity of technologies, while Society Readiness Levels (SRLs) gauge societal acceptance  of these technologies. In fashion, these assessments help evaluate the feasibility, scalability, and market adoption of innovations.    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>

Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) are a systematic metric used to assess the maturity of a particular technology, from its initial concept to full market adoption. In the fashion industry, this involves evaluating technologies such as smart textiles, sustainable materials, and advanced manufacturing processes. Additionally, Society Readiness Levels (SRLs) gauge the acceptance of these innovations within society, ensuring that technological advancements are not only feasible but also embraced by consumers and stakeholders. This unit will explore how TRLs and SRLs are used to evaluate the feasibility, scalability, and market adoption of fashion innovations.


### Case Studies

**Kornit Digital**  
*Kornit Digital* is a company focused on sustainable, on-demand, digital textile printing technologies. Their innovations in high-speed, zero-waste printing are a great example of TRL application in the fashion industry. By reducing the water and energy footprint of traditional textile printing, they have successfully moved from an R&D stage to full commercial adoption. Their success also reflects a positive SRL outcome, as consumers and brands increasingly demand eco-friendly production methods.

**Vollebak**  
Vollebak is an experimental clothing brand using cutting-edge materials and technologies. Their graphene jacket, for instance, is made from one of the strongest and most conductive materials on Earth. This is an example of how a small brand can implement advanced technology (TRL) while gauging societal acceptance (SRL). The market is still testing the readiness for high-tech materials like graphene in everyday wear, making this a clear case of integrating both TRL and SRL evaluation.

**Colorifix**  
Colorifix is a biotech startup using DNA to transfer color onto fabrics, replacing synthetic dyes with a more sustainable, biological alternative. This technology has moved through the early TRL phases and is now being adopted by smaller, eco-conscious brands. In terms of SRL, Colorifix appeals to consumers who are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental damage caused by traditional dyeing processes, and as a result, their innovation is seeing growing market acceptance.

**Petit Pli**  
Petit Pli is a children's clothing brand that uses advanced material technology to create garments that grow with the child. By implementing pleated fabric that expands, Petit Pli minimizes waste and the need for frequent clothing purchases. Their innovative design has passed the early TRL stages and successfully reached commercialization. From an SRL perspective, their product appeals to sustainability-conscious parents who appreciate reducing waste and extending the lifespan of children's clothing.
