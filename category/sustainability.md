# SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability encompasses practices that aim to minimize the negative environmental and social impacts of the industry. It involves adopting sustainable materials, reducing waste and emissions, promoting ethical labor practices, and embracing circular economy principles. The goal is to create a more responsible and resilient fashion industry that prioritizes environmental stewardship and social well-being.

## From sustainable to circular materials

Sustainable to circular materials refers to the shift in the fashion industry towards using materials that not only have a low environmental impact but also contribute to a circular economy. Sustainable materials are those that are responsibly sourced, produced with minimal harm to the environment, and have a reduced carbon footprint. These materials may include organic cotton, hemp, recycled polyester, and other eco-friendly alternatives.  However, the concept of circular materials goes beyond sustainability by emphasizing the need for materials that can be recycled, reused, or biodegraded at the end of their life cycle.

Circular materials aim to close the loop by ensuring that resources are continuously used and waste is minimized. This involves designing products with materials that can be easily disassembled, separated, and transformed into new materials or products through recycling or upcycling processes.  To achieve the transition from sustainable to circular materials, various strategies are employed in the fashion industry. This includes the use of innovative technologies and processes to create materials that are both sustainable and recyclable. For example, companies may develop fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles, discarded textiles, or agricultural waste.

Furthermore, the implementation of extended producer responsibility (EPR) programs can encourage brands to take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products, including the materials used. EPR programs promote the collection, recycling, and responsible disposal of products at the end of their use.  In addition, collaborations and partnerships between fashion brands, textile manufacturers, and recycling facilities play a crucial role in driving the adoption of circular materials. By working together, they can develop scalable solutions and innovative techniques to transform waste materials into new fibers, fabrics, or components for the fashion industry.

Overall, the shift from sustainable to circular materials in the fashion domain represents a more holistic approach to environmental sustainability. It aims to reduce the industry's reliance on finite resources, minimize waste generation, and promote a circular economy where materials are continuously cycled and reused, contributing to a more sustainable and regenerative fashion industry.

## Design for disassembly

Design for disassembly is an approach that involves intentionally designing products in a way that allows for easy and efficient disassembly at the end of their life cycle. It focuses on creating products that can be easily taken apart, separating different components and materials for reuse, recycling, or other forms of responsible disposal.

This design principle aligns with the 6Rs of sustainability, particularly the concepts of reuse, repair, and recycle.  Design for disassembly means creating garments and accessories with components that can be easily separated and disassembled. This includes using fasteners, connectors, or other mechanisms that enable the straightforward removal of individual parts, such as buttons, zippers, linings, and trims. By considering the disassembly process during the design phase, fashion products can be more easily repaired, altered, or repurposed.

The aim of design for disassembly is to extend the lifespan of fashion items and reduce waste. By enabling disassembly, it becomes easier to repair damaged parts, replace worn-out components, or transform the garment into a new style. This approach promotes circularity by facilitating the reuse of materials and reducing the need for new resource extraction.

Designing for disassembly also supports the recycling process. By separating different materials, such as fabrics, buttons, and zippers, at the end of a garment's life, these components can be recycled more effectively. Designers can consider using recyclable materials and avoiding complex material blends that are challenging to separate. This enables the recycling of fashion products into new textiles or other usable materials, contributing to a more sustainable and closed-loop system.

Furthermore, incorporating design for disassembly in fashion can encourage a shift towards a more sustainable and responsible consumption mindset. When consumers are aware that their garments are designed for disassembly, they are more likely to engage in repair, alteration, or recycling initiatives. This promotes a culture of conscious consumption and encourages individuals to participate actively in the circular economy.

In summary, design for disassembly in the fashion domain involves intentionally designing products with the ability to be easily disassembled at the end of their life cycle. It promotes the principles of reuse, repair, and recycle, as part of the 6Rs of sustainability. By considering disassembly in the design process, fashion products can be more easily repaired, components can be reused or recycled, and the overall environmental impact of the fashion industry can be minimized.

## Designed for multiple uses

Designed for multiple uses refers to the strategic approach of creating garments and accessories that can be adapted, modified, or styled in various ways to cater to different occasions and individual preferences. This design philosophy promotes sustainability, longevity, and versatility, allowing consumers to maximize the utility and enjoyment of their fashion items while minimizing waste and the need for excessive consumption.

When fashion items are designed for multiple uses, it promotes sustainability and reduces waste by extending the lifespan of the product. Instead of having a single-purpose item that may only be worn on rare occasions, designing for multiple uses encourages consumers to get more wear out of their clothing, maximizing its value and minimizing the need for constant new purchases.

This design approach often involves incorporating elements such as detachable or adjustable components, convertible silhouettes, modular designs, or versatile styling options. For example, a garment may have removable sleeves, allowing it to be transformed from a long-sleeved top to a sleeveless blouse. Similarly, a dress may feature detachable layers or interchangeable accessories, enabling it to be styled differently for various events or seasons.

By designing for multiple uses, fashion brands can cater to the evolving needs and preferences of consumers. It allows individuals to express their personal style and creativity while reducing the environmental impact of the fashion industry.

Additionally, it promotes a more conscious consumption mindset by encouraging consumers to invest in high-quality, versatile pieces that can be worn repeatedly in different ways, rather than buying single-purpose items that may quickly go out of style or lose their appeal.

## More than human design

More than human design, refers to a design approach that considers not only the needs and preferences of human users but also the broader ecological and social impact of fashion products. It takes into account the well-being of all stakeholders involved, including animals, ecosystems, and the environment.

This design approach acknowledges the interconnectedness of all living beings and aims to create fashion products and systems that are sustainable, ethical,inclusive, and respectful of all living beings, promoting a harmonious relationship between fashion and nature.

More than human design recognizes that fashion does not exist in isolation from the natural world and other species. It acknowledges the detrimental effects of traditional fashion practices on the environment, such as pollution, waste generation, and the exploitation of resources. More than human design seeks to mitigate these negative impacts by integrating sustainable practices throughout the entire fashion value chain.

More than human design involves adopting alternative materials and production methods that minimize harm to animals and the environment. This includes using plant-based and recycled materials, adopting organic farming practices, and reducing the use of harmful chemicals in textile production. It also entails considering the welfare of animals and ensuring that fashion products do not involve the use of fur, exotic skins, or other materials obtained through cruel practices.

Furthermore, more than human design extends beyond product design and encompasses the entire lifecycle of fashion, from sourcing to manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal.

## Collaborative consumption

Collaborative consumption, also known as the sharing economy or peer-to-peer sharing, refers to a consumption model in which individuals or communities share resources, products, or services among themselves rather than owning them individually.

It is a shift away from traditional ownership-based consumption towards a more collaborative and access-based approach. In the fashion domain, collaborative consumption involves sharing and exchanging clothing and accessories, allowing individuals to access a wide range of fashion items without the need for full ownership.

Collaborative consumption can take various forms. One prominent example is clothing rental platforms, where individuals can rent garments for a specific period rather than purchasing them outright. These platforms provide access to a diverse selection of clothing styles and brands, allowing users to experiment with different looks and wear designer pieces at a fraction of the cost. It promotes a more sustainable approach to fashion by reducing the need for single-use garments and encouraging the reuse of clothing items.

Another aspect of collaborative consumption in fashion is peer-to-peer sharing platforms, where individuals can lend or borrow clothing from one another. These platforms facilitate direct interactions between users, creating a community-driven sharing network.

Users can list their own clothing items that they are willing to lend, and others can borrow those items for a specific duration. This fosters a sense of community and promotes the idea of shared ownership, enabling individuals to maximize the usage of their wardrobe and reduce the overall demand for new clothing.

Collaborative consumption in the fashion domain can also extend to clothing swaps or exchanges. These events or online platforms enable individuals to exchange their pre-owned clothing items with others. Participants bring in garments they no longer wear or need and can swap them for items of similar value. Clothing swaps promote sustainability by giving garments a new lease on life and reducing the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills.

Furthermore, collaborative consumption can involve co-creation platforms where users can participate in the design process of fashion items. This allows individuals to contribute their ideas, preferences, and skills, resulting in personalized and unique clothing pieces. Through these platforms, users can collaborate with designers or brands to create custom-made garments or accessories, fostering a sense of involvement and creativity in the fashion experience.

## Enabling repairability

Enabling repairability refers to the intentional design and production of fashion items that allow for easy and effective repair and maintenance. It involves incorporating durable materials, modular designs, and accessible repair services and resources to extend the life-cycle of fashion products and promote sustainable consumption patterns.

To enable repairability, fashion brands focus on several key aspects. First, they prioritize the selection of durable and high-quality materials that can withstand wear and tear. This includes using strong stitching, reinforced seams, and robust fabrics that are less prone to damage. By choosing materials with longevity in mind, brands create products that can be repaired and maintained over time.

In addition to materials, the design of fashion items plays a crucial role in enabling repairability. Brands may adopt modular designs, where different components of a garment can be easily replaced or repaired without affecting the overall integrity of the piece. For example, a jacket with detachable and interchangeable buttons or a pair of shoes with replaceable soles allows for specific parts to be fixed or replaced rather than discarding the entire item.

Furthermore, enabling repairability involves providing access to repair services and resources. Brands may collaborate with skilled artisans or partner with repair workshops to offer repair services for their products. They may also provide customers with repair kits, guidelines, or tutorials that empower them to perform minor repairs themselves. By facilitating repair options, brands encourage customers to extend the life of their fashion items instead of replacing them.

Moreover, a comprehensive approach to enabling repairability also includes considerations for the availability and accessibility of spare parts. Brands may maintain inventories of replacement buttons, zippers, clasps, or other components, ensuring that customers can easily obtain the necessary parts for repairs. They may also establish partnerships with suppliers or retailers to ensure the availability of these components for an extended period.

Overall, enabling repairability in the fashion domain involves a holistic approach to design, materials, resources, and services. By prioritizing durability, adopting modular designs, providing repair services and resources, and ensuring the availability of spare parts, brands empower customers to prolong the life of their fashion items through repairs. This approach promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and encourages a shift towards a more circular fashion industry.

## Post-use materials

Post-use materials refers to materials that have been previously used by consumers and are no longer needed in their original form. In the fashion domain, post-use materials typically refer to textiles and clothing items that have reached the end of their life cycle and are ready for disposal or recycling.

Post-use materials encompass various types of textiles and garments that have served their primary purpose and are no longer suitable for continued use. These materials can include worn-out or damaged clothing, discarded textile scraps, surplus inventory, or even products returned by customers. Instead of being discarded as waste, these materials can be redirected into recycling or upcycling processes to create new products or extend their lifespan.

The concept of post-use materials aligns with the principles of circular economy and sustainable fashion. Rather than perpetuating a linear "take-make-dispose" model, post-use materials present an opportunity to recover and reintegrate valuable resources back into the fashion supply chain. By collecting, sorting, and processing these materials, fashion brands and manufacturers can reduce the environmental impact associated with production and minimize waste generation.

In addition to recycling, post-use materials can also be repurposed or upcycled. Repurposing involves transforming the materials into new products or applications, while upcycling entails creating higher-value products from the existing materials. These approaches contribute to the reduction of resource consumption and promote a more sustainable and circular fashion industry.

## Joining closed-loop recycling

Joining closed-loop recycling in the fashion domain refers to the practice of participating in a recycling system where materials from discarded or worn-out garments are collected, processed, and reintroduced into the production of new clothing items. It involves creating a closed-loop system where the materials used in the fashion industry are continuously recycled and reused, reducing the need for virgin resources and minimizing waste.  In more detail, joining closed-loop recycling involves several steps and stakeholders:

#### Collection

Garment brands or retailers collect used clothing items from consumers through various channels, such as in-store collection bins, take-back programs, or mail-in options. These items may include damaged garments, unsold inventory, or customer returns.  Sorting and Processing: The collected garments are sorted based on their material composition, condition, and potential for recycling. This step ensures that different materials can be appropriately processed and transformed into new products. Any non-recyclable components, such as zippers or buttons, are separated for proper disposal.

#### Recycling and Regeneration

The sorted garments are then processed through various recycling methods, such as mechanical recycling or chemical processes. Mechanical recycling involves shredding the textiles into fibers, which can be spun into new yarns and fabrics. Chemical processes, such as depolymerization or dissolution, break down the textile fibers into their base components for the production of new materials.

#### Manufacturing

The recycled materials are transformed into new fashion products, including clothing, accessories, or even footwear. These products may incorporate a blend of recycled materials with virgin materials, depending on the desired quality and performance.

####  Consumer Awareness and Education

Communicating the importance and benefits of closed-loop recycling to consumers is crucial. Brands and retailers play a vital role in raising awareness about the recycling programs they offer, educating customers about the significance of recycling, and encouraging them to participate in the closed-loop system.

By joining closed-loop recycling, fashion brands and retailers contribute to the circular economy by extending the lifespan of materials, reducing waste, and minimizing the environmental impact of the fashion industry. This approach promotes resource efficiency, reduces the demand for new raw materials, and helps address the issue of textile waste.

## Waste reduction

Waste reduction in the fashion domain refers to the implementation of strategies and practices aimed at minimizing the generation of waste throughout the entire lifecycle of fashion products. It involves conscious efforts to reduce, reuse, recycle, and repurpose materials and resources in order to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainability.

Waste reduction is crucial due to its significant contribution to environmental degradation. The production of clothing involves the extraction of raw materials, energy-intensive manufacturing processes, and the disposal of unused or discarded items. This results in substantial waste generation, including textile scraps, production leftovers, unsold inventory, and post-consumer waste.

To address these challenges, waste reduction initiatives adopt various approaches and principles:

####  Sustainable Design

Waste reduction begins at the design stage by integrating sustainable practices. Designers focus on creating products with longevity, durability, and versatility to minimize the need for frequent replacements. They also consider using materials that are recyclable, biodegradable, or made from recycled sources.

####  Efficient Production Processes

Manufacturers employ lean production techniques and technologies to optimize material usage, minimize production waste, and enhance efficiency. These include implementing just-in-time manufacturing, reducing overproduction, and adopting advanced cutting and pattern-making techniques to minimize fabric waste.

####  Recycling and Upcycling

Waste reduction involves the recycling and upcycling of textile waste and discarded garments. Recycling refers to the process of converting textile waste into new fibers or products, while upcycling involves transforming waste materials into higher-value products. Both approaches help divert waste from landfills and promote the circular economy by reintroducing materials back into the production cycle.

####  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)

EPR is a waste management concept where manufacturers take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products throughout their lifecycle. It involves implementing strategies such as product take-back programs, designing for disassembly, and ensuring proper end-of-life treatment to minimize waste and facilitate recycling.

####  Consumer Awareness and Education

Encouraging consumers to make conscious purchasing decisions and adopt sustainable fashion practices is vital for waste reduction. Brands and organizations promote awareness campaigns, provide information on responsible consumption, and educate consumers on the importance of recycling, repairing, and donating clothing to minimize waste.

### Case studies

#### Reformation

Reformation is a sustainable fashion brand known for its commitment to waste reduction. They prioritize sustainable materials, minimize fabric waste through efficient pattern-making, and focus on local manufacturing to reduce transportation emissions. They also offer a "Clothes the Loop" program where customers can return old garments for recycling.

#### TALA

TALA is a UK-based activewear brand that incorporates recycled materials into their products. They use fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles and engage in waste reduction by designing for circularity, ensuring their products can be easily recycled at the end of their life.
